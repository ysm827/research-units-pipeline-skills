# research-units-pipeline-skills

> Languages: **English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This project uses semantic skills to turn research workflows into reusable pipelines.

It is designed for the space between fragile prompting and overly rigid scripting. By organizing research tasks into staged pipelines with explicit artifacts, checkpoints, and guardrails, it makes complex work more reusable, inspectable, and iterative. The result is a workflow that can be resumed, audited, and continuously improved instead of being rebuilt from scratch each time.

## What This Repo Covers

The codebase currently centers on eight workflow contracts:

| Workflow | Use it for | Default deliverable | English | 中文 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `arxiv-survey` | evidence-first literature surveys when you want the draft and evidence stack before PDF delivery | `output/DRAFT.md` | [Guide](readme/arxiv-survey.md) | [说明](readme/arxiv-survey.zh-CN.md) |
| `arxiv-survey-latex` | the same survey workflow when compile-ready LaTeX/PDF is part of the contract from the start | `output/DRAFT.md`, `latex/main.tex`, `latex/main.pdf` | [Guide](readme/arxiv-survey.md) | [说明](readme/arxiv-survey.zh-CN.md) |
| `research-brief` | fast topic understanding and reading-path briefs from a small paper set | `output/SNAPSHOT.md` | [Guide](readme/research-brief.md) | [说明](readme/research-brief.zh-CN.md) |
| `paper-review` | traceable single-paper critique, lab review, or referee-style assessment | `output/REVIEW.md` | [Guide](readme/paper-review.md) | [说明](readme/paper-review.zh-CN.md) |
| `evidence-review` | protocol-driven evidence synthesis with screening, extraction, and bounded conclusions | `output/SYNTHESIS.md` | [Guide](readme/evidence-review.md) | [说明](readme/evidence-review.zh-CN.md) |
| `idea-brainstorm` | literature-grounded research direction discovery and discussion memos | `output/REPORT.md` | [Guide](readme/idea-brainstorm.md) | [说明](readme/idea-brainstorm.zh-CN.md) |
| `source-tutorial` | transform multi-source materials into a reader-first tutorial with PDF and Beamer slides | `output/TUTORIAL.md`, `latex/main.pdf`, `latex/slides/main.pdf` | [Guide](readme/source-tutorial.md) | [说明](readme/source-tutorial.zh-CN.md) |
| `graduate-paper` | restructuring an existing Chinese graduation thesis project into a thesis engineering workflow | pipeline + thesis skill packages | [Guide](readme/graduate-paper.md) | [说明](readme/graduate-paper.zh-CN.md) |

These workflows share the same architecture:

- `pipelines/` defines stage contracts, artifact expectations, and required skills.
- `.codex/skills/` holds the reusable skills.
- `workspaces/` stores per-run artifacts and intermediate outputs.
- `readme/` contains feature-level documentation.

Use these workflow names directly. The old alias names have been removed from active routing.

## Skills And Harness

The repo has two layers:

- **Skills** are the semantic units. They describe the research judgment: what to read, what artifact to produce, what acceptance criteria apply, and what guardrails must not be violated.
- **The harness** is the deterministic support layer around those skills. It initializes workspaces, runs unit scripts, validates pipeline contracts, checks generated dependency docs, diagnoses workspace state, records per-unit output manifests, recovers interrupted `DOING` units, and runs CI smoke tests.

Keep that split when changing the project: put domain judgment and writing policy in skills; put repeatable checks, recovery, and orchestration in the harness.

## Core Concepts

- `Pipeline`: the contract for a workflow. It defines stages, artifacts, checkpoints, and required skills.
- `Skill`: a reusable capability with explicit inputs, outputs, acceptance criteria, and guardrails.
- `Workspace`: the working directory for a single run under `workspaces/<name>/`, where generated artifacts are written.

The important design choice is artifact-first execution. The model is not expected to keep the whole workflow in memory; it writes intermediate structure, evidence, and review outputs to disk so later stages can build on them.

## When To Use Which Workflow

Use `arxiv-survey` when the goal is a serious review paper with explicit retrieval, structure review, evidence packs, and writing loops, but PDF is not required yet.

Use `arxiv-survey-latex` when the same survey workflow must also deliver compile-ready LaTeX/PDF artifacts.

Use `research-brief` when the goal is to understand a topic quickly, surface the key themes, and produce a reading path rather than a full survey.

Use `paper-review` when the input is a single paper or manuscript and the goal is to assess its claims, evidence, novelty, and risks.

Use `evidence-review` when the goal is to synthesize a candidate pool under an explicit protocol with screening, extraction, and bounded conclusions.

Use `idea-brainstorm` when the goal is to generate a literature-backed memo of candidate research directions for discussion, not to write a paper yet.

Use `source-tutorial` when you already have webpages, PDFs, notes, repo docs, or documentation sites and want to turn them into a reader-first tutorial rather than a survey or memo.

Use `graduate-paper` when you already have thesis materials such as a template, existing TeX, Overleaf drafts, PDFs, figures, or prior papers, and need to reorganize them into a Chinese degree thesis workflow. This path is currently the least automated among the major workflows.

## Three Parallel Review Products

`research-brief`, `paper-review`, and `evidence-review` are now three parallel entry points rather than one workflow with light/heavy modes.

| Workflow | Typical input shape | Internal data flow | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `research-brief` | topic prompt, small paper pool, or query seed | topic -> small core set -> outline -> compact briefing | `output/SNAPSHOT.md` |
| `paper-review` | one paper or manuscript | manuscript -> claims -> evidence gaps + novelty matrix -> review | `output/REVIEW.md` |
| `evidence-review` | review question plus candidate pool | question -> protocol -> screening -> extraction + bias -> synthesis | `output/SYNTHESIS.md` |

They are optimized for different user intents:

- `research-brief`: fast orientation and reading-path generation
- `paper-review`: single-paper assessment with traceable critique
- `evidence-review`: auditable many-paper synthesis under an explicit protocol

## How To Use The Repo

1. Start Codex in this repository.
2. Choose a workflow, or describe the outcome you want.
3. Let the selected pipeline write artifacts into a workspace.
4. Inspect the generated files at the relevant checkpoint before continuing.

Typical prompts:

```text
Write a LaTeX survey about embodied AI and show me the outline first.
```

```text
Use the research-brief workflow to give me a one-page briefing on test-time adaptation for robotics.
```

```text
Use the paper-review workflow to critique this manuscript and give me a lab-style review.
```

```text
Use the evidence-review workflow to run a PRISMA-style review on LLM agents for education.
```

```text
Brainstorm literature-grounded research ideas around embodied agents for home robotics.
```

```text
Use the source-tutorial pipeline to turn webpages and repo docs about robot learning into a tutorial with PDF and slides.
```

```text
Use the graduate-paper workflow to reorganize my Chinese thesis materials before rewriting chapters.
```

If you want tighter control, pin the pipeline directly:

- [pipelines/arxiv-survey.pipeline.md](pipelines/arxiv-survey.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md](pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/research-brief.pipeline.md](pipelines/research-brief.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/paper-review.pipeline.md](pipelines/paper-review.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/evidence-review.pipeline.md](pipelines/evidence-review.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/idea-brainstorm.pipeline.md](pipelines/idea-brainstorm.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/source-tutorial.pipeline.md](pipelines/source-tutorial.pipeline.md)
- [pipelines/graduate-paper-pipeline.md](pipelines/graduate-paper-pipeline.md)

## Developer Harness

Use these checks before changing pipeline contracts or skill IO:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/validate_repo.py
python scripts/audit_skills.py
python scripts/generate_skill_graph.py
python scripts/pipeline.py doctor --workspace workspaces/<name>
```

`validate_repo.py --strict --no-check-quality` is the blocking contract gate for executable pipelines. `audit_skills.py` reports review signals by default and exits non-zero only for blocking errors. `pipeline.py doctor` is the workspace-level harness check: it shows the current checkpoint, unit status counts, the next runnable unit, missing dependencies, and missing DONE outputs. Scripted units also write `output/unit_logs/<unit>.<skill>.manifest.json` with output hashes for traceability.

## Recommended Reading Path

1. Read this file for the repo-level picture.
2. Open the feature guide that matches your task and language.
3. Open the matching pipeline contract under `pipelines/`.
4. Inspect the relevant skills under `.codex/skills/` if you need to change behavior rather than just run it.

## Current Status

- `arxiv-survey` / `arxiv-survey-latex` are the most complete writing path in the repo and the main survey route, depending on whether PDF is required.
- `research-brief`, `paper-review`, and `evidence-review` now form the review-oriented product family: quick understanding, single-paper assessment, and protocol-driven synthesis.
- `idea-brainstorm` is structured and executable, but optimized for discussion-ready idea memos rather than paper drafting.
- `source-tutorial` is the tutorial path: source-grounded, tutorial-first, with article PDF and Beamer slides as first-class delivery artifacts.
- `graduate-paper` now has a clearer pipeline design and a first batch of thesis-oriented skills, but it should currently be treated as a guided workflow framework rather than a fully automated thesis runner.
